# Masonry Layout - Pinterest
An pinterest like website but not functional at all , used columns property to achieve the masonry layout.


This website is fully responsive , the size of images changes across different width size of screens .<br><br>
First i had used the column-count property for the layout but to make it responsive i had to use media queries , instead of that i found a new way to do this without any media queries and in just one-line using the columns property , it allows images of different layouts to retain their aspect ratios and also makes them responsive.

## Navigation Bar :

Ive reused the navigation bar i had made for the amazon clone project and modified it a little bit , by adding some icons,etc

## Credits :
I Found about the columns property from A youtube channel named "Lun Dev Code" , he creates some pretty cool css videos.<br>
